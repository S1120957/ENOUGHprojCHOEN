This repository contains a blockchain-based Choreography Enforcer (CHOEN). The application takes as input a BPMN 2.0 Choreography diagram, and synthesize a Solidity smart contract that act as an enforcer of actors trying to implement the choreography in their production processes.

CHOEN is still a prototype. The current stable version is based on a comand-line interface (CLI) where the user inputs the simulated events and observes whether the enforcer allows such events or not (perhaps they will be delayed, or postponed indefinitely). In future versions, a REST API interface will allow to seemlessly integrate it with (local or remotely connected) third party apps.

# Preliminaries

## Linux/Ubuntu without VSCode

In order to test the current status of the project, follow a guide for creating a virtualenv. In the following we assume that you use the scripts known as `mkvirtualenv` (e.g. [see this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/virtualenv-with-virtualenvwrapper-on-ubuntu-18-04/)). Next you have to setup the environment variables 

```
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=bpmn2solidity.settings
export PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/git/choen/code:$PYTHONPATH
```

## Windows or Linux with VSCode

You can follow this guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python . Remember to export the environment variables as described above.

# First execution

The first time you execute the CHOEN tool, the required Python libraries must be installed, and a database must be initialized. Use the following commands:
```
$ workon <your_venv>
(your_venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(your_venv) $ django-admin migrate
```

In the following we assume you were able to execute the commands above, and are still typing commands in the same terminal shell where you activated your virtual environment.

# Running the automated tests

Automated tests can be executed with the following command:
```
(your_venv) $ django-admin test bpmn_parser
```

At the moment, some tests have not been aligned with the most recent changes in code, thus resulting in some test failures.

# Using the enforcer

The CHOEN tool has two prompts:
- `>>` is the **outer** prompt
- `+>` is the **inner** prompt

The *outer* prompt is used to setup the CHOEN enforcer with operations such as selecting the BPMN choreography to be enforced, synthesize and compile the enforcing smart contract, setup the blockchain parameters and start the enforcer. 

The *inner* prompt is used to input the (simulated) events and observe whether the enforcer returns them immediately (thus allowing their immediate execution) or delays them. A delayed output means that an event is acceptable provided that previous events are observed. An output may even been postponed indefinitely, because the preconditions (i.e. other events) are never observed. Note that since the enforcer is generated from a BPMN choreography, when we speak of events we mean an exchange of messages among the actors of the choreography itself.

The tool starts executing with the outer prompt. The `start` command (see below) switches from the outer prompt to the inner one. When executing in the inner prompt, the `/stop` command (see the `stop`) brings back the tool to the outer command. 

The CHOEN tool is launched with the following command:
```
(your_venv) $ django-admin cli
```

## Using the outer prompt

Below is the list of commands interpreted by the outer prompt.

| Command | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `help` | Return the list of available commands |
| `exit` | Exits the tool |
| `quit` | Exits the tool |
| `init` | Initialize  the application loading the BPMN choreographies. |
| `init -clean` | Initialize  the application by first deleting the BPMN choreographies and then loading them again. This command is useful when a BPMN choreography diagram is updated and loaded again in the directory of the application. |
| `clear` | Remove all the BPMN choreographies from the database. |
| `list` | List the BPMN choreographies previously imported in the database. |
| `load <diagram_name|path_of_diagram.bpmn>` | If a diagram with the given name is found in the database, it is loaded by the enforcer. Otherwise, a file at the given path is imported into the database and then loaded by the enforcer |
| `load_instance <id>` | Load the running instance with the provided identifier `<id>` (if it exists) and then switches the tool from the outer prompt to the inner prompt |
| `start` | Start the enforcer. It creates a new running instance and then switches the tool from the outer prompt to the inner one |
| `stop` | Stop the enforcer, preserving the current state that can be queried (using the `dump ...` commands) or saved (using the `save ...` commands). It switches the tool from the inner prompt to the outer prompt |
| `env` | Print a list of "variables" used by the tool internally |
| `env <var>` | Print the value associated to the specified variable |
| `env <var> <value>` | Set a value to the specified variable in the tool environment |
| `dump status` | Retrieve the status of the NFA associated to the BPMN choreography |
| `dump curr_states` | Retrieve the current status of the NFA associated to the BPMN choreography |
| `dump transitions` | Retrieve the transitions of the NFA associated to the BPMn choreography |
| `dump buffer` | Retrieve the events in the enforcer buffer |
| `stats` | Return a table with the transaction statistics |
| `history` | Return the list of all transactions with the states of the NFA and of the buffer after each of them |
| `save nfa <dir> <name> <format>` | Save the NFA used by the enforcer in the file `<name>.<format>`, provided the format is known to the `dot` utility for drawing graphs; the specified directory `<dir>` is used to store temporary files |

The outer prompt saves a history file for remembering the sequence of commands input by the user. The file can be found at the following path: `${HOME}/.choen_cli`.

## Using the inner prompt

The inner prompt accepts a sequence of events as input from the user. An event is the label of a message as defined in the BPMN diagram used to setup the enforcer itself.

If the input starts with the `/` symbol, the rest of the line is interpreted as a command for the outer prompt. In this way, the user can -at any time during the execution of the inner prompt- execute any command of the outer prompt. For instance, in order to stop the enforcer, the user can input `/stop`. In order to dump the transitions allowed by the enforcer, the user can input `/dump transitions`. And so on.

The inner prompt saves a history file for remembering the sequence of commands input by the user. The file can be found at the following path: `${HOME}/.choen_enforcer`.

## On-chain vs Off-chain Enforcer engine

The enforcer can be used either plugging the **off-chain** engine or plugging the **on-chain** engine.

The off-chain engine is a straightforward Python implementation of the enforcer rules. It does not require any special configuration, and can be used in order to test the logic of the enforcer.

The on-chain engine generates two Solidity smart contracts implementing the enforcer rules and a non-deterministic finite automaton at the core of the enforcer on-chain itself. The on-chain engine is also responsible for deploying the smart contracts, provided that the users configured the required parameters of the enforcer. To this aim, the following command displays the enforcer parameters:
```
>> env
ONCHAIN_URL = None
ONCHAIN_CHAIN_ID = None
ONCHAIN_ADDRESS = None
ONCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY = None
```
If you use a public test (e.g. Sepolia) for testing the on-chain engine, you should configure the enforcer as follows:
```
>> env ONCHAIN_URL <your_blockchain_url>
>> env ONCHAIN_CHAIN_ID <your_chain_id>
>> env ONCHAIN_ADDRESS <your_wallet_address>
>> env ONCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY <your_private_key>
```
Remember that the commands above (thus your address and private key) are stored in the outer prompt history file (`${HOME}/.choen_cli`).

# Example of use
Starting from the terminal, you can execute the following commands:
```
(your_venv) $ django-admin cli
>> init
>> load <diagram_name>
```

At this stage, if you want to use the on-chain engine, execute the `env ...` commands for configuring the blockchain parameters (see [above](#on-chain-vs-off-chain-enforcer-engine)). 

The next step (for both cases: the on-chain engine, as well as the off-chain engine) is to start the enforcer:
```
>> start
```

Next you can provide your input to the enforcer and see how it reacts. To send a stream of events (every event must be separated with a space) you can write it in the CLI, such as the rest of the commands, but without the character "/" as prefix. Every event must have the following sintax:

- sending a message: `<actor_id>!<message_id>`
- receiving a message: `<actor_id>?<message_id>`

The sequence of events returned by the enforcer represents the sequence in which such events can be executed. Each actor in the choreography is expected to input the event it is ready to execute. If the event is returned back from the enforcer, it means it is allowed to execute it in compliance with the choreography. Otherwise, the actor has to wait if and when the enforcer emits such event back, before actually executing it.

# The WEB GUI

In order to use the WEB GUI, you need to run the internal web-server in your virtualenv:
```
(your_env) $ django-admin runserver
```

Then, use your favourite browser to access the following URL: `http://localhost:8000/admin`.

Note that at the moment, you can use the WEB GUI to prepare new running instances, but you cannot feed them using the WEB GUI, at the moment. At the moment, the user can only feed events through the CLI and the REST API.

# The REST API

In order to use the REST API, you need to run the internal web-server in your virtualenv (as for the WEB GUI scenario, above):
```
(your_env) $ django-admin runserver
```

Next, you can use your favourite browser to navigate the automatically generated documentation at the following URL: `http://localhost:8000/api`. 

Finally, you can program your application to use the endpoints published by the API (navigate the documentation in order to discover them). 

# Drawing choreographies

At the moment the choreography diagrams are generated using the following online tool:
